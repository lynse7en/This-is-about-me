## 📖 Project Overview
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting employee attrition in an HR dataset using multiple machine learning models. By identifying key factors that drive attrition, the project aims to help HR teams take proactive actions to improve employee retention.  
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling for model readiness.  
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed attrition patterns by demographics, tenure, and job roles using visualizations.  
  - **Model Development**: Built and compared **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to predict attrition.  
  - **Model Evaluation**: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
  - **Model Selection**: Compared trade-offs between interpretability and predictive performance, ultimately selecting **Logistic Regression** as the most suitable model for HR decision-making.  
  - **Insights & Recommendations**: Highlighted key drivers of attrition and suggested HR strategies for employee engagement.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Techniques**: Data Preprocessing, EDA, Classification Models, Model Comparison & Selection, Feature Importance  
---
## 🌟 Achievements
- Built and benchmarked three models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
- **Logistic Regression** was chosen as the final model for its **explainability**, enabling HR leaders to understand the impact of each factor on attrition.  
- Identified critical features influencing attrition such as job satisfaction, tenure, and salary.  
- Delivered actionable insights to support **data-driven HR decision-making**.  
## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience in comparing multiple ML models for a real-world HR problem.  
- Understanding trade-offs between **interpretability (Logistic Regression)** and **predictive performance (XGBoost, Random Forest)**.  
- Gained skills in building a complete ML workflow: data preparation → model comparison → model selection → business insights.
